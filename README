This is a fork of : http://github.com/sochotnicky/pywebcal

I wanted pywebcal to handle http urls instead of webDAV. So I've 
removed the webdav parts, used http to get the ical data. 
Also by default the calender will be cached for 12 hours.

There is an example in the examples directory : webcaltest.py
